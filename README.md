# One AI Model, Written Four Different Ways.
A comparative study of Iris classification using PyTorch, TensorFlow, vanilla Python, and C#
---
Typically you'd build an AI model using the most popular and modern Python library: PyTorch. You can find that implementation in the PyTorch directory.

Another popular library is the TensorFlow library and I've implemented that as well within the TensorFlow directory. The same model, the same data, but in 2 different libraries.

I decided to implement a model that uses no ML library - just using only math and python code - whew that was a hard one. You can find it in the PythonPure library.

Lastly I built the same model in DotNet using the ML.NET library. I figured I'd understand this model the best of the four since I work with C# a lot. Well I was wrong. But you can find that code in CSharp folder. 
Enjoy.
