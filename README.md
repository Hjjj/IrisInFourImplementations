Typically you'd build an AI model using the most popular and modern Python library: PyTorch. You can find that implementation in the PyTorch directory.
Another popular library is the TensorFlow library and I've implemented that as well within the TensorFlow directory. The same model, the same data, but in 2 different libraries.
I decided to implement a model that uses no ML library - just used only math and python code - whew that was a hard one. You can find it in the PythonPure library.
Lastly I build the same model in .netcore using the ML.NET library. I figured I'd understan this model the best since I work with C# a lot. Well i was wrong. But you can find that code in CSharp folder. 
Enjoy.
